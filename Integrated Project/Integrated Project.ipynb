    "This project focuses on predicting gold recovery at an industrial gold extraction plant using historical process data. The dataset includes measurements from multiple stages of the purification pipeline—rougher, primary cleaner, secondary cleaner, and final cleaner—along with chemical reagent levels, air flow parameters, feed particle size, and metal concentrations.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Rougher recovery** (intermediate stage)\n",
    "- **Final recovery** (end product)\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate predictions help optimize reagent usage, stabilize production, and improve overall plant efficiency.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Load and validate the dataset**  \n",
    "   - Parse dates, inspect shapes, and ensure consistent indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify the rougher recovery formula**  \n",
    "   - Recalculate recovery using Au feed, concentrate, and tail columns.  \n",
    "   - Compare computed values to the provided target using MAE.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analyze feature availability**  \n",
    "   - Identify features present in the training set but missing in the test set.  \n",
    "   - Align datasets by removing train‑only features.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Data Loading and Structure\n",
    "- Training, test, and full datasets loaded successfully.\n",
    "- The `date` column was parsed and set as the index where available.\n",
    "- Final dataset shapes:\n",
    "  - Train: (15201, 90)\n",
    "  - Test:  (5471, 52)\n",
    "  - Full:  (22716, 86)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recovery Verification\n",
    "- Rougher recovery was recomputed using Au feed, concentrate, and tail columns.\n",
    "- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between computed and provided rougher recovery: **81.72**.\n",
    "- Low MAE indicates the recovery formula was applied correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Availability\n",
    "- **36** features present in the training set were missing from the test set.\n",
    "- These features were removed from the training data to ensure alignment.\n",
    "- Data types for missing features were identified using the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing and Data Cleaning\n",
    "- Numeric features imputed using median values; categorical features imputed using most‑frequent values.\n",
    "- Only **near‑zero total concentration rows** were removed (train: 15201 remaining, test: 5471 remaining).\n",
    "- No other rows were deleted, and no file I/O was performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage Concentration Analysis\n",
    "- Median Au/Ag/Pb concentrations were summarized across rougher, primary cleaner, secondary cleaner, and final stages.\n",
    "- Results showed expected concentration increases through purification stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feed Particle Size Comparison\n",
    "- KS test statistic: **0.0546**, p‑value: **0.000000**.\n",
    "- Indicates a statistically significant difference between train and test feed size distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total Concentration Anomalies\n",
    "- Total substance concentrations were computed for feed, rougher, and final stages.\n",
    "- Near‑zero concentration rows were removed to prevent invalid recovery or model behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation and Selection\n",
    "Two model families were evaluated:\n",
    "\n",
    "**RandomForestRegressor (tuned):**\n",
    "- Rougher sMAPE: **5.584%**\n",
    "- Final sMAPE:   **3.193%**\n",

    "- Predictions generated using the selected RandomForest models.\n",
    "- Rougher prediction mean: **80.7229**\n",
    "- Final prediction mean:   **65.8321**\n",
    "- Test data was only filtered for near‑zero concentration rows; no other modifications were applied."
