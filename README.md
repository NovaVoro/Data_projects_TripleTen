# Data_Science_projects_TripleTen
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Video Game Sales Forecasting | Analyze reviews, genres, platforms, and historical sales data to identify the patterns that predict whether a video game will become successful so the store can better target future hits and plan marketing. |
| 2 | Machine Learning in Business | Build a model that predicts oil reserves across three regions so you can select the most profitable wells and identify the region with the highest expected profit while evaluating risk through bootstrapping. |
| 3 | Integrated Project | Build a machine learning model that predicts rougher and final gold recovery from detailed process‑stage and reagent data to improve efficiency and production stability at the extraction plant. |
| 4 | Linear Algebra | Use machine learning to find similar customers, predict insurance benefits, and apply privacy‑preserving data masking without hurting model performance. |
| 5 | Numerical Methods | Build a model that delivers accurate price predictions, runs quickly for users, and trains efficiently for the team. |
| 6 | Time Series | Build a machine‑learning model that predicts the number of taxi orders one hour into the future. |
